On this year beginning I set some boundaries(goal) for myself. Almost nearly 9 months completed now. Till now I fulfilled only few of my goals. In this blog, I am going to explain my plan for next 100 days to achieve my remaining goals with my daily routine.

Completed goals

**Goal 1** : For this goal, I am going to record my whole day from my wake up to sleep for next 100 days. Seems like 100 days coding challenge. I will have to discontinue this society and social media for next 100 days. On this challenge I need to focus my other goals as well (note : some goals are related my profession).

**Goal 2 :** why I chose [React](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WcY3@-2x0kgcJ2XxQ9PBspPJ8NTgyq1Q0k2yWBTUs0Z6irNUxVkpClS_WNQdIsSGAZwNk/) and [JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@eMzyUHSzvdJWaQAmyLti9GwkI9hSilXJVt8e9GdNh6aRDdfiBwhvjyuhlwYgLgo8/) ? I am currently working react with typescript. Typescript(syntactical superset of JavaScript) is totally new for myself and before this I know python. That python knowledge helped me to speed up my JS learning journey. I partially completed that course and react course as well. But I lose my consistency during this course completion. I need to keep my consistency to complete these courses.

**Goal 3 :** From my learnings, I always believe in practical knowledge. Usually, If learned something new I have to practice that and get output for that. Obviously I will done this goal during my learning goal.

**Goal 4 :** [Talking Yak](https://www.talkingyak.com/) is an Android-based English teaching system. Always I want to improve my communication and my language. This application helped me in many ways to improve Grammar, Phonics, Vocabulary and Speech. I completed 67 percentage on this. Need to complete remaining.

**Goal 6 :** ”Try to fit myself” I didn’t have any source to complete this goal. I am going to fit myself without any equipments. we will see how it’s going.
