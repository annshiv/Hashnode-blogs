Hello my name is Annamalai and I am working as software developer at lumel

I am writing this article with hopes that self-taught developers like myself might be employed as the rate of unemployment is pretty high. I graduated in electronics engineering. Then you may think like this *“why did he choose to program as a career ?”*. I have some basic C programming knowledge from my 10th standard. I thought, “programming languages are working with help of electronics. So electronics were doing a major role in software development”. So I chose electronics engineering for my graduation. after one year only I realized my thought was totally wrong.

I started my programming journey in my second year, I started with python. Literally, I spend all my time with python (programming language). Each and every day I returned to the hostel after my college hours, I start to learn python. Initially, I learned programming language from my native language(Tamil) and YouTubers([Tamil Hacks 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/c/TamilHacks20)). Then I started with english youtubers ([Tech with tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim), [Clever Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer), [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh)). These days I can code a little bit still I am not able to solve problematic questions.

Then I solved 3 problematic questions for each day. During those times my daily goal was to learn some concepts and need to solve some problems from those concepts. I solved problems from ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Quvi](https://www.guvi.in/code-kata)). Days passed, and the pandemic came. then I started my 100 days coding challenge. I have written a specific [blog](https://dev.to/annshiv/my-100-days-of-coding-journey-3ege) for that. I completed almost nearly 25+ projects. At that time I could able to write code for some intermediate-level problems.

Python is a general purpose language and all general purpose languages can be used at both the front end and back end. But it doesn’t have a popular framework like react or angular. so I need to learn to react or angular to continue my developer journey. I started HTML and CSS with the help of one [course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013eA3@Q9YL9ZeikONZ63OEMhMWCTAgXLr0G5tOgemZ8USJQDnGRTD9RtlwTb58Uu4_qit2/). I completed more than 5 projects only with these. Here is another crucial situation for me, I need JavaScript because most of the frontend frameworks work with JavaScript. I started Javascript from one [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@YrwJCESWQyJuJxXZg7q0zwIy126LqWEJCwHnV7YW7R4bidohVnRWblWY_psRQ9Zd/). I completed some projects with these. Then I learned angular along with one freelancing project. meanwhile, I landed a software developer job which I expected.

> *Research shows that you begin learning in the womb and go right on learning until the moment you pass on. Your brain has a capacity for learning that is virtually limitless, which makes every human a potential genius*

I can proudly say that I can do software developer work as I have learned JavaScript, React, Angular, Python, Node.js, Git, Collaboration, Pair Programming, Team work as well as HTML/CSS.
